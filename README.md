## Proposal of Application
Our mission is to to end hunger by providing food and groceries to the ones who need it. We are supported by our donors and partners in this mission. 

## How it works? 

We have partnered with restaurants and grocery chains who donate their fresh, leftover food to us. After receiving the food we inspect it, package it and update it’s availability on our website. Just add to cart whatever you need and we’ll place the order in the closest available locker near your location. This application tries to avoid crowd and and assurance and visibility about your food package Pick up the food and enjoy!
